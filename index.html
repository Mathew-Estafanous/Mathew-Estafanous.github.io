                            Ur-Codebin is a website aimed at creating an easy to use code sharing platform, that allows
                            users to quickly and efficiently share their code with others.  Quickly paste a snippet of your
                            code, chose from a variety of options then click “Upload!” From that, you can now take the link
                            and share it with the world! The goals of creating this website is to create a well designed system
                            that  incorporates many technologies like RESTful APIs, Docker, Spring Boot and Nginx to ultimately
                            come out with the optimal product. Ensuring proper security was a crucial aspect of this project in
                            which I learned about different security technologies such as JWT and BCrypt algorithm.

                            The goal of Ur-Weather App is to quickly provide all the weather information you will need in a
                            very simple and easy to use manner. You can get the current, hourly and daily weather for any location
                            that you chose. This application integrates the GeoDB API for city coordinates which are then used to
                            get weather information from the ClimaCell API. To ensure up to 4x faster response times, all information
                            is asynchrously retreived and processed to ensure maximum use of resources.

                            This is simple space simulation that generates an entire universe through the use of one universe seed.
                            Generated planets have their own number of moons, colour, size, etc. which can all be simulated. Orbiting
                            moons and a simulation of the planet's land can be shown and will always remain consistent if the user would
                            like to revisit the planet. This project was started after I had an interested in object procedural generation.
                            After researching about all kinds of terrain and object generation I decided to create this project to apply my
                            new knowledge in a basic form that would help me understand the different concepts of procedural generation.
