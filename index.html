                       Welcome! I’m glad you're here! My name is <span class="highlight">Mathew</span> and
                       I am an enthusiastic developer who is excited to use my growing development knowledge
                       to make a difference. I am a computer science student who is currently studying at Ryerson University,
                       located in downtown Toronto.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       During my spare time, I take any opportunity to work on some <span class="highlight">Personal Projects.</span>
                       If you don’t find me working on software projects, you can find me reading a book, out with friends,
                       or snowboarding - if the weather allows it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       I am always excited to connect with others and learn about their involvement in tech and talk
                       about our different experiences. Please reach out to me either through my <span class="highlight">LinkedIn</span>
                       or by <span class="highlight">Email</span>. As always, it’s great to meet you!

                            Open Stage is a Q&A platform that promotes discussions and dialogue free from judgement. Users can
                            simply join a room and begin asking questions, related to the topic, while also remaining anonymous.
                            The backend of the app is built using Golang and it exposes a REST API to the client. The API also
                            enforces general security by requiring JWT access tokens when the client is trying to access sensitive
                            information. To better understand how this API is built, checkout the GitHub repository and 
                            associated documentation.

                            Ur-Codebin is a website aimed at creating an easy to use code-sharing platform, that allows
                            users to quickly and efficiently share their code with others.  Quickly paste a snippet of your
                            code, choose from a variety of options then click “Upload!” From that, you can now take the link
                            and share it with the world! The goal of creating this website is to create a well-designed system
                            that incorporates many technologies like RESTful APIs, Docker, Spring Boot and Nginx to ultimately
                            come out with the optimal product. Ensuring proper security was a crucial aspect of this project in
                            which I learned about different security technologies such as JWT and BCrypt algorithm to ensure user
                            information and authentication was secured.

                            I built and tested my own implementation of the raft consensus algorithm, which is a distributed systems
                            algorithm. It allows for a cluster of finite state machines to contain the same committed data while also
                            remaining fault tolerant in the case of an unexpected server crash. Programmed the raft nodes to communicate using
                            gRPC as the standard for communication.

                            that you chose. This application integrates the GeoDB API for city coordinates which are then used to
                            get weather information from the ClimaCell API. To ensure up to 4x faster response times, all information
                            is asynchronously retrieved and processed to ensure maximum use of resources.

                            A space simulation that generates an entire universe through the use of one universe seed.
                            Generated planets have their set of moons, colours, size, etc. which can all be simulated. Orbiting
                            moons and a simulation of the planet's land can be shown and will always remain consistent if the user would
                            like to revisit the planet. This project was started after I had an interest in object generation and persistence.
                            To ensure minimal memory usage, only visible objects are generated and when they are out of view they are all
                            destroyed. Data persistence is as simple as storing a space region and its seed ID. whenever the space region
                            becomes visible, it looks up the ID in a HashTable and generate the region using the seed ID!

                            Watch poro as he sends you motivational messages or even play with him by tossing him around and
			                watching him bounce. This project was completed in about 30hrs for HackTheNorth 2020++, which is
                            a major hackathon run by the Waterloo Engineering department. Some noteable aspects of the project involve
                            state management, physics handling and the graphics of the pet.
