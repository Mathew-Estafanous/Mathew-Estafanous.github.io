                       Welcome! I’m glad you're here! My name is <span class="highlight">Mathew</span> and
                       I am an enthusiastic developer who is excited to use my growing development knowledge
                       to make a difference. I am a high school student who is currently studying out of Toronto,
                       Canada - more specifically the GTA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       During my spare time, I take any opportunity to work on some <span class="highlight">Personal Projects.</span>
                       If you don’t find me working on software projects, you can find me reading a book, out with friends,
                       or snowboarding - if the weather allows it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       I am always excited to connect with others and learn about their involvement in tech and talk
                       about our different experiences. Please reach out to me either through my <span class="highlight">LinkedIn</span>
                       or by <span class="highlight">Email</span>. As always, it’s great to meet you!

                            Ur-Codebin is a website aimed at creating an easy to use code-sharing platform, that allows
                            users to quickly and efficiently share their code with others.  Quickly paste a snippet of your
                            code, choose from a variety of options then click “Upload!” From that, you can now take the link
                            and share it with the world! The goal of creating this website is to create a well-designed system
                            that incorporates many technologies like RESTful APIs, Docker, Spring Boot and Nginx to ultimately
                            come out with the optimal product. Ensuring proper security was a crucial aspect of this project in
                            which I learned about different security technologies such as JWT and BCrypt algorithm to ensure user
                            information and authentication was secured.

                            The goal of the Ur-Weather App is to quickly provide all the weather information you will need in a
                            very simple and easy to use manner. You can get the current, hourly and daily weather for any location
                            that you chose. This application integrates the GeoDB API for city coordinates which are then used to
                            get weather information from the ClimaCell API. To ensure up to 4x faster response times, all information
                            is asynchronously retrieved and processed to ensure maximum use of resources.

                            A space simulation that generates an entire universe through the use of one universe seed.
                            Generated planets have their set of moons, colours, size, etc. which can all be simulated. Orbiting
                            moons and a simulation of the planet's land can be shown and will always remain consistent if the user would
                            like to revisit the planet. This project was started after I had an interest in object generation and persistence.
                            To ensure minimal memory usage, only visible objects are generated and when they are out of view they are all
                            destroyed. Data persistence is as simple as storing a space region and its seed ID. whenever the space region
                            becomes visible, it looks up the ID in a HashTable and generate the region using the seed ID!

                            Desktop poro is a cute interactable pet that walks around ontop of your desktop while you are working.
                            Watch poro as he sends you motivational messages or even play with him by tossing him around and
			                watching him bounce. This project was completed in about 30hrs for HackTheNorth 2020++, which is
                            a major hackathon run by the Waterloo Engineering department. Some noteable aspects of the project involve
                            state management, physics handling and the graphics of the pet.
