                       Welcome! I’m glad your here! My name is <span class="highlight">Mathew</span> and
                       I am an enthusiastic developer who is excited to use my growing development knowledge
                       to make a difference. I am a high school studenty who is currently studying out of Toronto,
                       Canada - more specifically the GTA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       During my spare time, I take any opportunity to work on some <span class="highlight">Personal Projects.</span>
                       If you don’t find my working on software projects, you can find me reading a book, out with friends,
                       or snowboarding - if the weather allows it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       I am always excited to connect with others and learn about their involvement in tech and talk
                       about our different experiences. Please reach out to me either through my <span class="highlight">LinkedIn</span>
                       or by <span class="highlight">Email</span>. As always, it’s great to meet you!
                    </p>
