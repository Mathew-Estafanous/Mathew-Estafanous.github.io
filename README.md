</p>

Welcome to my portfolio website repository. As I've continued to grow and expand my knowledge, I want a better way to display my work and grow my online presence. What better way than creating my own portfolio website where I can show my work!

At the same time, I got the opportunity to further my experience using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I also got the chance to try out JQuery for the first time.

## Where can I find the website?

The website is hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to allow for a very seemless and easy deployment of my website whenever I want. To see the website, you can head to https://mathewestafanous.com and check it out yourself!

## What was the design approach?

I'm far a good designer so my priority when thinking of the design of the website was for something simple and easy to follow. With that in mind, I chose a one page layout with all the information being ordered in sub headings as you scroll down.

To plan out the design, I got the chance to learn and use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) as I planned out the layouts and possible animations for the portfolio website.

## Where can I recommend changes?

As always, with any project, you can recommend any changes in the [issues](https://github.com/Mathew-Estafanous/Mathew-Estafanous.github.io/issues) section of the repository. Any change is greatly appreciated, even the ones pointing out a simple spelling mistake.
